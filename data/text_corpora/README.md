# Textual datasets

### Description
This directory contains the data collected from websites.     
Texts have been all put together.      
There is one file per language.    
Unfortunately, no written data were found in Serer language on the Web. We attempted to use OCR techniques on books bought in bookstore or found in Senegalese libraries, but in vain.    

#### Corpus details
File | \#Lines | \#Words | \#Characters    
| :------------- | -------------: | -------------: |  -------------: |
pulaar.txt | 37,643 | 742,024 | 4,124,173     
wolof.txt | 56,693 | 1,140,508 | 5,403,065     

### Post-processing
Non roman characters were removed from raw texts.    
Punctuation is preserved for future customisation.    
Post-processing just consisted in the addition of a new line after each final punctuation mark (the dot, exclamation and question marks) and spaces between other kind of typography mark (such as comma, colon, semi-colon, dash, bracket, etc.).
