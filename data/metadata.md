## Recordings
The recordings are from various types of programmes and are rated on a scale of 1 to 5 based on their potential complexity for speech processing.    
This rating is subjective and takes into account factors such as recording duration, number of talking speakers, and recording conditions.     
A rating of 1 indicates relatively low complexity, while a rating of 5 indicates relatively high complexity.
